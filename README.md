  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as I had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs (*The warning icon was sourced from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544499/how-to-make-a-styled-markdown-admonition-box-in-a-github-gist)*).

## 1. The purpose of this module

As noted on the [applied-statistics github repository](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics),the aim of this module is to enable you to demonstrate your ability to:

1. Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.
1. Source documentation to programmatically perform a statistical test.
1. Select an appropriate statistical test to investigate a claim.
1. Perform a statistical test on a data set.

## 2. Introduction



## 3. How to get started

### Necessary software

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct software. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficient space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

### **Additions to** *.gitignore*

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
  7. Windows.gitignore

## How to run the project

### Using Visual Studio Code & Anaconda or GitHub Codespaces

**Clone the Repository**:

```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/Laura6826/applied-statistics-8651
```

**Install the required packages**:

For a seamless executition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files. The libraries required to run this project.

**1. How to run the virtual environment**:

To get started, open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the root of the *applied-statistics-8651*. From there, activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system (for windows)

```ruby
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once activated, you'll see the environment’s name in your prompt (typically preceded by “(venv)”), indicating that the isolated Python environment is running. This setup ensures that all dependencies installed via the requirements.txt file are used exclusively for this project.

OR

**2. Manually install @requirements.txt'**:

```ruby
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Project Structure**:

```ruby

```

### Open in Visual Studio Code

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Open the `Applied Statistics 25-25:(8651)` folder.
- Open the folder associated with the assignment you wish to look at.

## 4. How to get help

I have attached below, a number of helpful links, should you wish to extrapolate on any of the methods used within this project.

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
1. [Matplotlib.py](https://matplotlib.org/)
1. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Additionally, a number of links are embedded within the code, in areas that I found confusing, that should help should there be any difficulty.

## 5. How to contribute

As this project was created to fulfil an assessment requirement of the Applied Statistics 25-25:(8651), as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics, no contributions will be allowed, in order to comply with ATU Policy on [Plagiarism](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) and the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2022-08/Student%20Code_Final_August_2022.pdf).
