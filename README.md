  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as I had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs (*The warning icon was sourced from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544499/how-to-make-a-styled-markdown-admonition-box-in-a-github-gist)*).

## 1. The purpose of this module

As noted on the [applied-statistics github repository](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics), the aim of this module is to enable you to demonstrate your ability to:

1. Describe the stochastic nature of real-world measurements.
1. Source documentation to programmatically perform a statistical test.
1. Select an appropriate statistical test to investigate a claim.
1. Perform a statistical test on a data set.

## 2. Introduction

This noteboook is created to fufil the assessment required for the module, Applied Statistics 25-25:(8651), Higher Diploma in Science, Data Analyticsis. The notebook is to demonstrate achievement of the learning outcomes for this module, to be submitted in a GitHub repository created solely for this assessment.

## 3. How to get started

### Necessary software

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct software. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficient space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

### **Additions to** *.gitignore*

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
  7. Windows.gitignore
